  ## Purpose: As a part of the Course Project for 'Getting and Cleaning Data', this R code has been written to 
  ## perform the following funcitons:
  ## Step 1: Load Subject and Activity data for Training and Test
  ## Step 2: Extract only the Mean and Standard Deviation variables from the features (which contains a total of 561 variables)
  ## Step 3: Merge the Subject and Activity data for Training and Test with Variables extracted in Step 2
  ## Step 4: Calculate the Average for the Training and Test data
  ## Step 5: Write the output text files for Mean/Standard Deviation and Average Training and Test data
  ## 
  ## Note: 
  ## 1. First the Training data is processed and then the Test data is processed
  ## 2. All data tables that begin with "tr" refer to Train data sets and "ts" refer to Test data sets
  ## 3. Training data represents 70% (7352) of the Subjects while Test data represents 30% of Subjects
